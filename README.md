# Automating-the-Student-Management-System-with-Stored-Procedures-
This project automates core operations of a Student Management System (SMS) using optimized stored procedures and functions. It streamlines tasks such as student registration, course enrollment and data retrieval by encapsulating logic directly within the database layer. The goal is to improve efficiency, ensure consistency,and enhance data integrity across all system operations.
The project includes well-structured routines for adding students, enrolling them in courses, fetching student–course or student–instructor mappings, updating contact information, and summarizing enrollments. Each routine is designed to reduce redundancy, enforce secure access, and support reusable, maintainable SQL logic. By centralizing business rules within the database, the system becomes more scalable, reliable, and easier to integrate with external applications.
